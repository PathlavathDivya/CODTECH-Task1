Overview of project:

### Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple, interactive calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program will prompt the user to input two numbers and select an operation. After performing the selected operation, the program will display the result.

### Steps

1. User Input: Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. Operation Selection: Ask the user to choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Perform Operation: Execute the chosen operation using the two numbers.
4. Display Result: Show the result of the operation to the user.

### Key Components

1. Input Handling: Using `input()` to get user input.
2. Conditional Statements: Using `if-elif-else` to handle different operations.
3. Arithmetic Operations: Basic operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

### Basic Structure

Here's a structured approach to writing the calculator:

1. Prompt User for Inputs:
    - First number
    - Second number
    - Operation choice

2. Perform Calculation:
    - Based on the chosen operation, perform the corresponding arithmetic calculation.

3.Display Result:
    - Print the result to the user.
###CODE EXPLAINATION:
1. Functions for Operations: 
    - `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
    - `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference between `x` and `y`.
    - `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of `x` and `y`.
    - `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`, checks for division by zero.

2. User Inputs:
    - Prompts the user to input two numbers and stores them in `num1` and `num2`.
    - Prompts the user to select an operation and stores the choice.

3. Conditional Statements:
    - Based on the user's choice, calls the corresponding function to perform the operation.

4. Result Display:
    - Prints the result of the operation.

This basic calculator can be extended to include more features, such as handling invalid inputs, adding more operations, or creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
